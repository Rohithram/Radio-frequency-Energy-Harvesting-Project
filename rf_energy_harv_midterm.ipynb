    "*  the received power is at best −20 dBm when using omnidirectional monopole antennas.\n",
    "* RF harvesting systems often use omnidirectional antennas, but this results in a low gain, and the system then relies only on high levels of available RF power"

    "## System Description : \n",
    "* The RF energy-harvesting system is designed to be operable in the 1.7–2.2- and 2.4–2.5-GHz bands\n",
    "* design the systems in such a way that they can work either jointly or as standalone devices.\n",
    "* Directional antennas are employed\n",
    "* They are placed on the device such that full azimuthal coverage is obtained. \n",
    "* Rectangular parallele-pipedcuboid approach with antennas on all six faces.\n",
    "* Four out of six faces for the Wi-Fi band and the remaining two for the cellular band. \n",
    "*  **Patch antennas** $\\rightarrow$ Wi-Fi band, Linear tapered slot antennas (**LTSAs**) $\\rightarrow$ cellular bands.\n",
    "* All RF signals are combined at the RF-Domain, instead of the dc power.\n",
    "* This enforces radiation pattern and an inherent circular array mode is excited.\n",
    "* But adds complexity and increases the size of the system\n",
    "* Performance of the system is evaluated by its efficiency. $\\eta = \\frac{P_{dc}}{P_{RF}}$ where $P_{dc}$ is the dc output power,$P_{RF}$ is the output power delivered from the antenna port.\n",
    "* Antenna Efficiency is not taken into account, as used antennas have atleast 90$\\%$ efficiency."

    "## LTSA: \n",
    "* It is an endfire radiating antenna.\n",
    "* Covers the azimuthal space by placing four antennas, one in each 90° sector, covering two faces with eight antennas.\n",
    "* Wide-band properties, can cover all of the allocated bands for the 3G signal around the world."

    "## Rectification of RF energy\n",
    "* Employed two antennas receiving in the same polarization and used a Greinacher voltage doubler in each antenna, to use positive and negative full wave rectification.\n",
    "* Advantage: We decrease the lowest level feasible for harvesting, as compared to a normal fullwave rectifier using Schottky diodes\n",
    "* A Diode is used, per antenna, to short-circuit the capacitor on the dc output side in the case of a reverse current. This current can appear if the levels of the incident signal vary between the two antennas. \n",
    "* In this case, the two dc capacitors will charge in different levels, creating a voltage difference resulting in a discharge current.\n",
    "* The diode avoids this effect with a minimal efficiency drop"
